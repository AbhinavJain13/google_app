Administrator Settings Panel :

	When you install the Google App module into your ATutor installation, you need to configure the module
according to your environment. To do this :

(1) Check all the desired services that you want to enable in the module, viz Google Docs, Google Calendars & Youtube.

(2) Register for a Google API Console account by visiting the following link - https://code.google.com/apis/console
You may use your existing Google Account to sign-in into Google API console. At the link :-

>>> Click on " Create project ", if you have never earlier worked with a Google API project; else, proceed to the next step.
       
>>> Now, click on the " Services " tab in the left pane. Make sure that the status of the Calendar API button is set to ON

>>> Next, click on the " API access " tab in the left pane. Click on the button that says - " Create an OAuth 2.0   Client ID ".

>>> Fill in the name for the product you're registering; in this case - "Google App Module" and click Next.

>>> Now comes the most important part of the API registration - configuring the Redirect URI.
    (a) Enter the name of your site or hostname at which the ATutor is installed.
    (b) Click on " Create " to create your OAuth 2.0 enabled Client ID.

>>> Next, you'll have to edit the settings to configure the exact the Redirect URI, which at present should be like - 
    <your_hostname.com>/oauth2callback. Click on " Edit settings... " in the right pane adjacent to your client-id information.

>>> In the textbox for " Authorised Redirect URIs ", you need to enter the correct path to the " calendar.php " file on    your domain.
      For e.g. <your_hostname.com> / <path_to_ATutor_installation> / mods / google_app / calendar.php.

>>> Leave the textbox for " Authorised Javascript Origins " as it is and click on " Update " to update the changes.

Now, you have registered for a valid Google API access account. Next configure the module settings.

>>> At the Google App Module Administrator Settings Panel, enter the values of Client ID configuration/s you just
    created at the Google API console. Copy and paste the values of Client ID, Client secret and Redirect URI.

>>> Click on " SAVE SETTINGS " tab, to save the desired admin settings.

This should complete the admin-configuration of the module.
